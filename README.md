Built using React.JS, the extention lives at the bottom right of the gmail window. It will pop up once the user opens an email and clicks on the extention. By default, content for Twitter is generated, however the previous selection from the user is saved for consecutive generations.

The repository has all the frontend code for the extention and leverages the logic implemented in the backend [here](https://github.com/AmritpalChera/MailDub-server).
